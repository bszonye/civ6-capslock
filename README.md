# Caps Lock 0.9.0  [<img align="right" src="capslock.jpg" height="256" width="256">](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1195009771)
Starting plot improvements for Civilization VI

Chooses better starting plots  
Improves capital spacing  
Prevents arctic wasteland starts  

I worked with UglyBoy and CowGoMoo on
[CivFanatics](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/fall-2017-start-position-fix.623655/)
to fix the starting position bugs in the Fall 2017 update.  (See the
[Starting Plot Scripts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1195040931)
collection for their mods.) This is my version of the fix, which emphasizes
distance between civs while upholding as many of the starting placement rules
as possible.

This is a beta version: I have tested it extensively, but I plan to further
tune the start position scoring.
