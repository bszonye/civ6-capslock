Starting plot improvements for Civilization VI

Caps Lock improves the rules for selecting starting locations. The game rates
each potential starting plot for factors like distance from other
civilizations, nearby luxury resources, and access to fresh water. The standard
rules use an all-or-nothing system that can place civilizations too close
together or stranded in arctic wasteland.

The mod improves the plot scoring system so that bigger problems get a worse
score, and multiple problems add up. For example, if a region is too close to
another civilization, the standard rules consider every plot equally bad, but
Caps Lock gives a better score to the plots that are farther away.

Caps Lock:  
Chooses better starting plots  
Improves capital spacing  
Prevents arctic wasteland starts  

## Compatibility
The [Yet (not) Another Maps Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=871861883)
mod provides its own starting plot rules and extra features, which will
override Caps Lock if you enable both.
